Image Classifier with Gradio
This repository contains Python code for a image classifier that utilizes Gradio for a user interface. The model is designed to classify images as cats or dogs.

=>Requirements:-
(1)Python 3.x
(2)Gradio (pip install gradio)
(3)Pillow (pip install Pillow)
(4)TensorFlow (Keras backend) (pip install tensorflow)
(5)NumPy (pip install numpy)
(6)Pre-trained Model and Labels

This code assumes you have a pre-trained Keras model (/content/keras_model.h5) and a corresponding labels file (/content/labels.txt) that contains class names (one per line). Ensure these files are placed in the same directory as your Python script.

=>Running the Script:-
(1)Download or clone this repository.
(2)Install the required libraries (mentioned above).
(3)Replace /content/keras_model.h5 and /content/labels.txt with the paths to your actual model and labels file if they are located elsewhere.
(4)Run the script using Python (python your_script_name.py).
(5)Using the Interface

The script launches a Gradio interface where you can upload an image. The model will predict the class (cat or dog) and display the confidence score if the confidence is above a predefined threshold.

=>Additional Notes:-
The code includes a confidence threshold to improve reliability.
You can adjust the confidence threshold (confidence_threshold = 0.8) in the script to control the minimum required confidence for a prediction.
This is a basic example, and more advanced techniques can be implemented for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection or handling a wider range of classes.
